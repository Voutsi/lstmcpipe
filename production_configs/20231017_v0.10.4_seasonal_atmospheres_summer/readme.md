# 20231017_v0.10.4_seasonal_atmospheres_summer

Full production of a test node simulated with a summer atmospheric profile. 
Reconstructed with random forests simulated with the same atmosphere.
The goal is to estimate the systematics introduced by using the same average winter atmospheric profile 
in order to analyse all LST data.
